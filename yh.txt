wesome — let’s make this super simple, like explaining a clubhouse with a suggestion box 😊

what is sentry (in kid terms)

imagine your website is a clubhouse.

sometimes things break (a toy falls) or kids want to leave a note (“add more crayons!”).

Sentry is a friendly helper that:

tells you when something broke (errors),

shows how it happened (replay),

gives visitors a feedback box to send you ideas or bug reports.

the pieces we’ll use

SENTRY_DSN: your clubhouse’s address so letters (events) reach the right place.

config files: instructions for the helper on the client (browser), server (Node), and edge (middleware).

Feedback button: a shiny button that opens the note box.

source maps: a secret decoder so error messages make sense.

sampling: “don’t record everything, only some” to keep things light.

step-by-step guide (copy–paste friendly)
0) requirements

Next.js (App Router or Pages is fine)

TypeScript

Node 18+

1) install
# guided install (recommended)
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i nextjs
# or manual
npm i @sentry/nextjs

2) add your secret address (DSN)

Create .env.local in your project root:

SENTRY_DSN=https://<key>@<org>.ingest.sentry.io/<project-id>
SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT=development   # change to production in prod
SENTRY_RELEASE=local-dev         # in CI, set this to your git SHA


DSN is like the mailbox address.

ENVIRONMENT is which clubhouse this is (dev, staging, prod).

RELEASE is which version of your clubhouse.

3) tell the helper how to behave

Create three files at the project root:

sentry.client.config.ts (runs in the browser)
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: process.env.SENTRY_DSN,
  // performance tracing
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  // profiling (optional)
  profilesSampleRate: 1.0,
  // session replay + feedback widget
  integrations: [
    Sentry.replayIntegration(),
    Sentry.feedbackIntegration({
      colorScheme: "system",
      showBranding: false,
    }),
  ],
  // record some sessions, all when an error occurs
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,
});


replayIntegration = “security camera” that records a bit of what users did (for debugging).

feedbackIntegration = “suggestion box” UI.

sentry.server.config.ts (runs on the server)
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: process.env.SENTRY_DSN,
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  profilesSampleRate: 1.0,
});


watches for server errors and slow endpoints.

sentry.edge.config.ts (optional, for middleware/edge routes)
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: process.env.SENTRY_DSN,
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});


same idea, but for edge functions.

4) wrap Next.js to upload “decoder rings” (source maps)

Edit next.config.ts:

import { withSentryConfig } from "@sentry/nextjs";
import type { NextConfig } from "next";

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
};

export default withSentryConfig(nextConfig, {
  silent: true,
  widenClientFileUpload: true,
});


this makes sure errors show your code lines, not scrambled build code.

5) add a feedback button (the suggestion box)

Make a small client component:

"use client";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

export function FeedbackButton() {
  return (
    <button onClick={() => Sentry.feedback.show()}>
      Send feedback
    </button>
  );
}


Put it in your header/nav:

import { FeedbackButton } from "@/components/FeedbackButton";

export default function Header() {
  return (
    <header>
      <h1>My SaaS</h1>
      <FeedbackButton />
    </header>
  );
}

6) (optional) manually report errors

When you catch an error and want to tell Sentry:

import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

try {
  // risky work here
} catch (err) {
  Sentry.captureException(err);
}


Server route example (App Router):

// app/api/ping/route.ts
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";

export async function GET() {
  try {
    throw new Error("Boom!");
  } catch (e) {
    Sentry.captureException(e);
    return NextResponse.json({ ok: false }, { status: 500 });
  }
}

7) test locally

npm run dev

open your site

click Send feedback, submit a test message

visit a page that throws an error (or hit /api/ping above)

check your Sentry project — you should see Feedback, Errors, maybe Replays

8) deploy (Vercel is easiest)

connect the Sentry ↔ Vercel integration (so source maps upload automatically)

set real envs on Vercel:

SENTRY_DSN

SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT=production

SENTRY_RELEASE (use Vercel’s commit SHA env var)

how each piece helps (quick recap)

.env.local → where to send reports (your DSN).

sentry.client.config.ts → watch the browser + record sessions + show feedback box.

sentry.server.config.ts → watch backend problems.

sentry.edge.config.ts → watch middleware/edge stuff.

next.config.ts with withSentryConfig → upload source maps so stack traces are readable.

FeedbackButton → users can report bugs/ideas anytime.

captureException → you can manually tell Sentry about problems you catch.

good defaults to start (and then tune)

dev/staging:

tracesSampleRate: 1.0

replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.2

production:

tracesSampleRate: 0.2

replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.01

keep replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0 (always record when an error happens)

tiny troubleshooting

No events show up? Double-check SENTRY_DSN and rebuild once.

Feedback button does nothing? Ensure it’s in a "use client" component.

Stack traces look weird? Confirm withSentryConfig is used and source maps are uploading (Vercel integration/CI).

Monorepo? Run the Sentry wizard in the app folder; ensure the config files are at the app root that builds.

If you want, share your repo structure (tree -L 2) and I’ll tailor the exact file paths and sampling for your SaaS.
